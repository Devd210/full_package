# Prerequisites for Python Scripts
- scipy
- numpy

# To run
1. Build the package using catkin build and make sure you have mw_msgs package
2. `rosrun route_scripts genroute_node`
3. Use the python client to send a service request: 
`rosrun route_scripts genroute_client.py scripts\unit_tests\test_*.yaml`

# To run the unit tests in order to check the script
'./run_test.py'
it will run the script through all the yaml files in the unit_tests folder, and output the result in the current directory

# naming convention
- waypoints file: waypoints_*.yaml
- route file: route_*.txt
- waypoints and route file will have same suffix, prefereably alphabets
- route file can have another suffix 'b', for files being generated by 'genroute_opp_heading.py'
- all suffix are separated by underscore '_'

# For help
`/genroute.py -h`
